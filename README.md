# ***Verto***
![Written in VB.NET](https://i.ibb.co/4Jr8n86/net-logo-1.png)
*Verto is a small application I made because I coudn't manage web apps in my browser. There are only 16 tabs as of now. I have a long plan for this application.* 
## Future plans
*I have a lot plans for the program, Some of them are listed below, others will be added when I think of them.*

 - Make the sidebar dynamic & scrollable
 - Make the sidebar buttons infinite as compared to 16 right now
 - Allow the user to add the button icon or fetch from the favicon
 - Add hover tool tip
## What currently works ?
*The current funtionality of the program is very limited. The buttons do work but are not customizable other than the URL they redirect to. You have to restart the program after saving the URLs for them to work correctly.*

## What did I use ?
*I used VB.NET to write the program, GunaUI2 for the UI framework and WebView2 for the browser control.*
## What is WebView2 ?
*WebView2 is a new Browser control for the .NET framework. Unlike older WebView controls, this does not require a complete seperate library. Instead this works on the pre-existing EDGE Browser available in Windows 10 based on the chromium engine.*

### ***Few things to concider***
*This is just a personal project with little to no motivation behind it. Programming is not something I do as a profession. This project might go to extreme lenghts and become something great or it could die right here with the first release. I'm making no promises. You are more than welcome to take the idea and create one yourself in any language (please someone do this. Electron is way better than VB.NET for this kind of project). You are free to fork this and do whatever you want with this, including selling the final product.*
